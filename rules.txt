GOAL: Clear out every tile on the board without clicking any mines

Left-click on a tile to clear it.
Empty tiles will indicate the number of adjacent mines.
If you click on a mine, it's game over!

Set/remove a flag (represented by an orange tile) with the right-mouse button.
Flags prevent a tile from being cleared. Use flags to mark tiles where you think there's a mine.

Use the number of adjacent mines to find where mines are, then mark them with flags.
